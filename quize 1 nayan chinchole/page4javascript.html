    <p><b>JavaScript</b> is a dynamic programming language commonly used in web development to create interactive and engaging
        web pages. It allows developers to add functionality to websites by enabling actions like form validation,
        animations, dynamic content updates, and user-driven events such as clicks and key presses. JavaScript runs on
        the client side, meaning it operates directly in a userâ€™s browser without needing to communicate with a server
        for every interaction. This makes websites more responsive and faster. JavaScript works alongside HTML, which
        structures the content, and CSS, which styles it, making it an essential component of modern web development. It
        is also used for server-side development through environments like Node.js. With its versatility, JavaScript is
        one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.
