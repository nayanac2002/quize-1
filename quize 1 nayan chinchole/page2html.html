    <p><b>HTML</b>, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language used to structure content on the web. It
        serves
        as the building block for creating web pages and applications. HTML defines how elements like text, images,
        links, and multimedia are arranged and displayed on a webpage. It organizes content into various sections, such
        as headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables, to ensure it is readable and accessible to users. While HTML
        primarily focuses on the structure of a webpage, it works in tandem with other technologies like CSS for styling
        and JavaScript for interactivity. HTML allows developers to create a wide range of web content, from simple text
        pages to complex multimedia applications. It is an essential skill for anyone looking to build websites or
        understand how the web functions.

    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the
        structure for web content by organizing text, images, links, and other elements into a coherent layout. HTML
        allows developers to define headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and more, making the content readable and
        well-structured. Although HTML handles the layout, it does not control the design or interactivity of the page.
        For that, it works alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to manage styling and JavaScript to add interactive
        features. HTML is an essential skill for anyone involved in web development, as it forms the backbone of all
        websites and web applications.</p>
