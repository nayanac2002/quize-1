    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language designed to format the layout of Web pages. It is used to
        enable the separation of presentation and content, which includes layout, colors, and fonts. They improve the
        accessibility of content, make it more flexible. CSS enables the specific look of html in the browser. CSS has lots of advantages. CSS is a great time-saver; you can write CSS once and then use the same sheet in multiple
        HTML pages. It provides multiple device compatibility; style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than
        one type of device.</p>

    <br>

    <p>In our CSS tutorial, you will learn how to use CSS to control the style and layout of multiple Web pages all at
        once. CSS was introduced together with HTML to provide a better way to style HTML elements.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Before you continue, you should have a basic knowledge about HTML because, with HTML tags, we create our pages,
        and with CSS, we give style to our tags. It means we make our page more beautiful. <b>HTML</b> is used to structure
        content while the CSS is used for structured formatting content. With CSS, we can change the color,
        background-color, font-size, etc. Our CSS guide provides some sections which cover the basic knowledge, CSS
        Properties, and Selectors.</p>
